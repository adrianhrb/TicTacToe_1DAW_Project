## About project

This repositorie is dedicated to 1DAW 1st trimester project. We are going to simulate a tictactoe and make it able to play on terminal. The program will be interactive, the users will introduce their names and then they will select the row and the line to put their figure. We will only use the tools seen on clase until the moment (lists, conditionals and loops)

## Modules

We will work only with a single file.
